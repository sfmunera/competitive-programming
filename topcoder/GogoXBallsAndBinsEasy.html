<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>Like all other software engineers, Gogo likes to play with bins and balls. He has N bins, numbered 0 through N-1. Yesterday, Gogo distributed all his balls into the bins, placing S[0] balls into bin 0, S[1] balls into bin 1, and so on. No two bins contained the same number of balls. It is possible that one of the bins contained zero balls.</p>
<br></br>
<p>This morning, Gogo attended a lecture about sorting. After he got home, he decided to rearrange the balls in his bins into sorted order. More precisely, he wanted to reach a state with <b>T</b>[0] balls in bin 0, <b>T</b>[1] balls in bin 1, and so on, such that the following two conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>T</b> is a permutation of S </li>
<li> <b>T</b> is sorted in ascending order </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose that S = {2, 5, 0}, i.e., there are 2 balls in bin 0, 5 balls in bin 1, and 0 balls in bin 2. Gogo would rearrange the balls to obtain <b>T</b> = {0, 2, 5}.</p>
<br></br>
<p>When rearranging the balls, Gogo always moves them one ball at a time. In other words, in each move Gogo takes a single ball from one bin and places it into another bin. Gogo is very smart, so he always uses the smallest possible number of moves.</p>
<br></br>
<p>For example, when rearranging S = {2, 5, 0} to <b>T</b> = {0, 2, 5}, Gogo will make exactly 5 moves. One way of changing S to <b>T</b> in 5 moves: first Gogo will move 3 balls from bin 1 to bin 2, and then he will move 2 balls from bin 0 to bin 2.</p>
<br></br>
<p>You just came to visit Gogo. You see that he already rearranged the balls. You are given a int[] <b>T</b> containing the current number of balls in each of the bins.</p>
<br></br>
<p>You do not know the original state S. The number of balls Gogo moved depends on S. For example, we already know that for S = {2, 5, 0} Gogo would move 5 balls. If he had S = {0, 5, 2} instead, he would also produce <b>T</b> = {0, 2, 5}, but this time he would only need 3 moves.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Your method must find and return the maximum number of moves Gogo could have performed. In other words, among all sequences S that produce the given sequence <b>T</b>, find one that requires the most moves, and return that number of moves.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>GogoXBallsAndBinsEasy</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>solve</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int[]</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int solve(int[] T)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>T</b> will contain between 2 and 10 elements, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>T</b> will be between 0 and 10, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>T</b> will be given in a strictly ascending manner.
