<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>You are interested in purchasing items from a number of stores in a local market. The market is composed of <b>N</b> stores numbered from 0 to <b>N</b>-1. The stores with numbers from 0 to M-1 are interesting to you and all the other stores are not interesting. Some pairs of stores are connected by roads.
<br></br><br></br>
You are given a String[] <b>interestingStores</b> which contains M elements and describes the interesting stores. The i-th element corresponds to store i and is formatted "OPEN CLOSE DURATION" (quotes for clarity), where OPEN is the opening time (in seconds), CLOSE is the closing time (in seconds) and DURATION is the time (in seconds) required to make a purchase in this store. You can initiate a purchase from a store at any time T between OPEN and CLOSE, inclusive. In order to do so, you need to arrive to the store at time T (or earlier). The purchase will be finalized at time T + DURATION and you need to stay at the store for the entire duration of your purchase. Note that it is possible for a purchase to end when the store is already closed. You cannot make multiple purchases in the same store.
<br></br><br></br>
The roads are given by the String[] <b>roads</b>. Each element of <b>roads</b> describes a single bidirectional road and is formatted "A B LENGTH" (quotes for clarity). Here A and B are the numbers of stores connected by the road and LENGTH is the time (in seconds) required to move from A to B (or from B to A) using this road.
<br></br><br></br>
Your start at time 0 at the location of store <b>N</b>-1. Return the maximum number of purchases in interesting stores that you can make.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>TravellingPurchasingMan</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>maxStores</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int, String[], String[]</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int maxStores(int N, String[] interestingStores, String[] roads)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>You are allowed to wait for any amount of time at any location.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>N</b> will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>roads</b> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>roads</b> will be formatted "A B LENGTH" (quotes for clarity), where A, B and LENGTH are integers with no unnecessary leading zeros.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each road, A and B will each be between 0 and <b>N</b>-1, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each road, A and B will be distinct.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each road, LENGTH will be between 1 and 604,800, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>There will exist at most one road between each pair of stores.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>interestingStores</b> will contain between 1 and min{16, <b>N</b>} elements, inclusive,</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>interestingStores</b> will be formatted "OPEN CLOSE DURATION" (quotes for clarity), where OPEN, CLOSE and DURATION are integers with no unnecessary leading zeros.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each store, OPEN will be between 0 and 604,800, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each store, CLOSE will be between OPEN+1 and 604,800, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>In each store, DURATION will be between 1 and 604,800, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{&quot;1 10 10&quot; , &quot;1 55 31&quot;, &quot;10 50 100&quot; }</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{&quot;1 2 10&quot;}</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: 1</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">It is not possible to make more than one purchase:
